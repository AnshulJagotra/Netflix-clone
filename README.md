# Netflix Clone

This is a basic Netflix clone that I created to practice and enhance my front-end web development skills. The project mimics the look and feel of Netflix's interface, allowing users to browse through movie and TV show titles.

## Features

### Responsive Design
- Developed with **HTML** and **CSS** to ensure the website adapts smoothly to various screen sizes and devices.

### Movie/TV Show Listings
- Created a static list of movies and TV shows using **HTML** with styled cards to resemble the Netflix layout.

### Hover Effects
- Added interactive hover effects using **CSS** for a more engaging user experience, including animations that highlight movie/TV show cards.

### JavaScript Functionality
- Incorporated **JavaScript** for basic interactions, such as dynamic content loading and simple carousel sliders to navigate through different categories.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Structure and content of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Styling, layout, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity and dynamic content management.
